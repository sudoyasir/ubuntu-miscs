# Ubuntu Miscs

This repository serves as a collection of my practice code snippets, exercises, and miscellaneous scripts written in Lua and Shell scripting. It's a space where I experiment, learn, and improve my skills in these two languages.

## About Lua

Lua is a powerful, efficient, lightweight, embeddable scripting language. It is used in a variety of applications, from games to web applications and more. In this repository, you will find Lua scripts that demonstrate various concepts, algorithms, and practical use cases.

## About Shell Scripting

Shell scripting refers to writing command-line scripts for automating tasks or executing sequences of commands in a Unix shell. The scripts in this repository showcase my exploration of shell scripting, covering topics such as system administration, automation, and more.
